CT angiography is a non-invasive imaging modality that uses intravenous contrast and high-resolution CT scanning to visualize vascular anatomy and pathology, providing two- or three-dimensional reconstructions that are particularly valuable for assessing large vessels but less sensitive for small distal vessels compared to invasive angiography.
