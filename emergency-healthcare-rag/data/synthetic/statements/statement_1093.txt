Hypothermia results from excessive heat loss or inadequate heat production leading to core body temperatures below 35 °C, while hyperthermia is characterized by a core temperature exceeding 40 °C due to failed thermoregulation, requiring prompt rewarming or cooling interventions respectively to prevent multi-organ dysfunction.
