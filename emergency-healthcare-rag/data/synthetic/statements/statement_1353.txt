Hypothermia results from excessive heat loss or inadequate heat production leading to a core temperature below 35 °C, while hyperthermia is characterized by a core temperature exceeding 40 °C due to failed thermoregulation, with treatment focused on active rewarming for hypothermia and rapid cooling for hyperthermia to prevent organ dysfunction.
