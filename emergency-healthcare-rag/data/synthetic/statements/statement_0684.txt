Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a highly specific biomarker for myocardial injury, with levels rising within 2 to 3 hours of ischemic onset, peaking between 12 and 48 hours, and its elevation above the 99th percentile is diagnostic of acute myocardial infarction when accompanied by appropriate clinical or ECG findings.
