Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is an acute inflammatory lung injury that presents within seven days of an insult, characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, severe hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 300 mm Hg, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring lung-protective mechanical ventilation to reduce mortality.
