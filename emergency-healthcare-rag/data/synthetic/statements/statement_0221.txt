Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute inflammatory lung injury characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, severe hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 300 mm Hg, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, often requiring lung-protective mechanical ventilation to minimize further lung damage.
