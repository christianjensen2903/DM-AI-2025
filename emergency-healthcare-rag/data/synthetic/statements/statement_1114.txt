Acute myocardial infarction is diagnosed by the presence of ischemic symptoms combined with new ST-segment elevation on ECG in contiguous leads or elevated cardiac troponin levels, with immediate reperfusion via percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 to 120 minutes being the preferred treatment for STEMI.
