Acute myocardial infarction encompasses STEMI and NSTEMI, with STEMI caused by complete coronary artery occlusion requiring urgent reperfusion via PCI within 90 to 120 minutes to reduce mortality, whereas NSTEMI typically involves partial occlusion managed initially with medical therapy and delayed PCI within 48 hours unless instability arises.
