Transthoracic echocardiography is a first-line, non-invasive imaging modality used to assess cardiac chamber size, ventricular function, valvular abnormalities, and hemodynamics, while transesophageal echocardiography provides higher-resolution images especially useful for evaluating posterior cardiac structures and diagnosing conditions such as infective endocarditis and left atrial appendage thrombus.
