Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency characterized by increased pressure within a closed osteofascial compartment, typically diagnosed when intracompartmental pressure exceeds 30 mmHg or when the delta pressure (diastolic blood pressure minus intracompartmental pressure) is less than or equal to 30 mmHg, necessitating prompt fasciotomy to prevent irreversible tissue ischemia.
