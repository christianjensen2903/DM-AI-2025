Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function, diagnosed by an increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or a urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour for at least six hours, and its causes are broadly categorized into prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal etiologies.
