CT angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive imaging modality that uses intravenous contrast and high-resolution computed tomography to provide detailed two- and three-dimensional visualization of vascular anatomy, serving as an excellent first-line diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases while offering limited resolution for small vessel evaluation compared to invasive angiography.
