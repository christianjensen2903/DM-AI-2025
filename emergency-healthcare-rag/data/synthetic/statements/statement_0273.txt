Hypothermia results from excessive heat loss or inadequate heat production leading to a core body temperature below 35 °C, whereas hyperthermia involves a failure of thermoregulation causing a body temperature above 40 °C, both requiring prompt temperature-specific interventions to prevent organ dysfunction.
